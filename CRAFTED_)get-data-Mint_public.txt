This workflow:
1. reads data in the EDM format (from Mint)
2. creates a unique filename for each file with an URI in the isShownBy value
3. writes the original image to a local disk (folder 'ORIGINAL')
4. writes the normalized images (max width 500px) to a local disk (folder 'NORMALIZED')
5. writes the metadata to a local MongoDB instance

Configuration:
- set path to local EDM file (exported from Mint)
- set CP name and dataset ID
- set path to local disk for downloaded and normalized files
- set mongoDB connection

Requirements:
- Python environment for Knime, as explained here: https://docs.knime.com/2018-12/python_installation_guide
- MongoDB Compass (see https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)
