This Knime workflow is part of a suite of tools developed for the CRAFTED project (https://pro.europeana.eu/project/crafted).

This workflow will extract text from a sound file, using the Google vision API. The workflow builds upon the results from the workflow 'CRAFTED_get-data-MINT_public'.

Workflow components:

1. read data about the sound file from a MongoDB and loads the image
3. execute a request to Google Vision speech to text engine
5. write the result in W3C annotation format to a file
6. write the result in W3C annotation format to the MongoDB

Configuration:
- set mongoDB connection to read image metadata [see workflow 'CRAFTED_get-data-MINT_public]
- set CP name and dataset ID
- set API key in Post Request node
- set mongoDB connection to write results
- set path to annotations folder

Requirements:
- Knime (https://www.knime.com/)
- MongoDB Compass (see https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)
- a Google Vision account and API_KEY (see https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text)
